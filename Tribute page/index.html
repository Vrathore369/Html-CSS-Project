          Here's a summary of the amazing life of Nikola Tesla
        </div>

        <h3>Synopsis</h3>
        <p>
          Inventor Nikola Tesla was born in July of 1856, in what is now
          Croatia. He came to the United States in 1884 and briefly worked with
          Thomas Edison before the two parted ways. He sold several patent
          rights, including those to his alternating-current machinery, to
          George Westinghouse. His 1891 invention, the "Tesla coil," is still
          used in radio technology today. Tesla died in New York City on January
          7, 1943.
        </p>
        <h3>Early Life</h3>
        <p>
          Nikola Tesla was born on July 10, 1856, in what is now Smiljan,
          Croatia. Tesla's interest in electrical invention was spurred by his
          mother, Djuka Mandic, who invented small household appliances in her
          spare time while her son was growing up. Tesla's father, Milutin
          Tesla, was a priest and a writer, and he pushed for his son to join
          the priesthood. But Nikola's interests lay squarely in the sciences.
          After studying at the Realschule, Karlstadt (later renamed the
          Johann-Rudolph-Glauber Realschule Karlstadt); the Polytechnic
          Institute in Graz, Austria; and the University of Prague during the
          1870s, Tesla moved to Budapest, where for a time he worked at the
          Central Telephone Exchange. It was while in Budapest that the idea for
          the induction motor first came to Tesla, but after several years of
          trying to gain interest in his invention, at age 28 Tesla decided to
          leave Europe for America.

        <h3>Famed Inventor</h3>
        <p>
          In 1884 Tesla arrived the United States with little more than the
          clothes on his back and a letter of introduction to famed inventor and
          business mogul Thomas Edison, whose DC-based electrical works were
          fast becoming the standard in the country. Edison hired Tesla, and the
          two men were soon working tirelessly alongside each other, making
          improvements to Edison's inventions. However, several months later,
          the two parted ways due to a conflicting business-scientific
          relationship, attributed by historians to their incredibly different
          personalities: While Edison was a power figure who focused on
          marketing and financial success, Tesla was commercially out-of-tune
          and somewhat vulnerable. After parting ways with Edison, in 1885 Tesla
          received funding for the Tesla Electric Light Company and was tasked
          by his investors to develop improved arc lighting. After successfully
          doing so, however, Tesla was forced out of the venture and for a time
          had to work as a manual laborer in order to survive. His luck changed
          in 1887, when he was able to find interest in his AC electrical system
          and funding for his new Tesla Electric Company. Setting straight to
          work, by the end of the year, Tesla had successfully filed several
          patents for AC-based inventions. Tesla's AC system eventually caught
          the attention of American engineer and business man George
          Westinghouse, who was seeking a solution to supplying the nation with
          long-distance power. Convinced that Tesla's inventions would help him
          achieve this, in 1888 he purchased his patents for $60,000 in cash and
          stock in the Westinghouse Corporation. As interest in an
          alternating-current system grew, Tesla and Westinghouse were put in
          direct competition with Thomas Edison, who was intent on selling his
          direct-current system to the nation. A negative-press campaign was
          soon waged by Edison, in an attempt to undermine interest in AC power.
          Tesla, for his part, continued in his work and would patent several
          more inventions during this period, including the "Tesla coil," which
          laid the foundation for wireless technologies and is still used in
          radio technology today. Unfortunately for Thomas Edison, the
          Westinghouse Corporation was chosen to supply the lighting at the 1893
          World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, and Tesla conducted
          demonstrations of his AC system there. Two years later, in 1895, Tesla
          designed what was among the first AC hydroelectric power plants in the
          United States, at Niagara Falls. The following year, it was used to
          power the city of Buffalo, New York, a feat that was highly publicized
          throughout the world. With its repeat successes and favorable press,
          the alternating-current system would quickly become the preeminent
          power system of the 20th century, and it has remained the worldwide
          standard ever since. In addition to his AC system and coil, throughout
          his career, Tesla discovered, designed and developed ideas for a
          number of other important inventions—most of which were officially
          patented by other inventors—including dynamos (electrical generators
          similar to batteries) and the induction motor. He was also a pioneer
          in the discovery of radar technology, X-ray technology, remote control
          and the rotating magnetic field—the basis of most AC machinery.

        <h3>The Fall from Grace</h3>
        <p>
          Having become obsessed with the wireless transmission of energy,
          around 1900 Nikola set to work on his boldest project yet: to build a
          global, wireless communication system—to be transmitted through a
          large electrical tower—for sharing information and providing free
          electricity throughout the world. With funding from a group of
          investors that included financial giant J. P. Morgan, in 1901 Tesla
          began work on the project in earnest, designing and building a lab
          with a power plant and a massive transmission tower on a site on Long
          Island, New York, that became known as Wardenclyffe. However, when
          doubts arose among his investors about the plausibility of Tesla's
          system and his rival, Guglielmo Marconi—with the financial support of
          Andrew Carnegie and Thomas Edison—continued to make great advances
          with his own radio technologies, Tesla had no choice but to abandon
          the project. The Wardenclyffe staff was laid off in 1906 and by 1915
          the site had fallen into foreclosure. Two years later Tesla declared
          bankruptcy and the tower was dismantled and sold for scrap to help pay
          the debts he had accrued.
        </p>
        <h3>Death and Legacy</h3>
        <p>
          After suffering a nervous breakdown, Tesla eventually returned to
          work, primarily as a consultant. But as time went on, his ideas became
          progressively more outlandish and impractical. He also grew
          increasingly eccentric, devoting much of his time to the care of wild
          pigeons in New York City's parks. He even drew the attention of the
          FBI with his talk of building a powerful "death beam," which had
          received some interest from the Soviet Union during World World II.
          Poor and reclusive, Nikola Tesla died on January 7, 1943, at the age
          of 86, in New York City, where he had lived for nearly 60 years. But
          the legacy of the work he left behind him lives on to this day.
